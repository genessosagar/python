Install CDK

$ cdk version
$ cdk help
$ cdk init sample-app --language python

$ cdk synth
Takes the local code and compiles into the cloudformation template

$ cdk bootstrap aws://AccountId/eu-west-2

After bootstrap to eu-west-2 region, whenever we use cdk deploy it was by default taking us-east-1 region.
For this reason the cdk deploy was not creating any resources
So first do cdk diff and cdk deploy worked

$ cdk diff
$ cdk deploy
